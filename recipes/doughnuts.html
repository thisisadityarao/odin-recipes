  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A doughnut or donut is a type of leavened fried dough. It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    <li>⅜ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
    <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar for dusting</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir the vinegar into the milk, and let stand for a few minutes until thick.</li>
    <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and vanilla until well blended. Sift together the flour, baking soda, and salt; stir into the sugar mixture alternating with the vinegar and milk. Roll dough out on a floured surface to 1/3 inch thickness. Cut into doughnuts using a donut cutter. Let stand for about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry doughnuts in the hot oil until golden, turning over once. Drain on paper towels. Dust with confectioners' sugar while they are still warm, and serve immediately.</li>
